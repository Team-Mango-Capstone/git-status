# Features

Upon logging in with their GitHub credentials, users can access a wealth of GitHub usage information in one centralized location, including:
* a timeline of contributions
* stats for their most-viewed repo
* recent account activity
* more detailed stats for each of their repos, including commit data, languages, collaborators, and more

Armed with the above insights, users can also set and monitor productivity goals using the following tools:
* a dashboard for setting and tracking progress on goals
* a task dashboard for smaller, everyday todos
* a badges feature and progress chart that helps users visualize their ongoing progress
